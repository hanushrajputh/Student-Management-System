# Step 1: Create a Database (if not already created)
CREATE DATABASE university_db;

# Step 2: Use the Database
USE university_db;

# Step 3: Create the Tables (if not already created)
CREATE TABLE Department (
    department_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,

# Step 4: Insert Data into Department Table
INSERT INTO Department (department_name) VALUES

# Explanation:
CREATE DATABASE: If you havenâ€™t created the database, this command will do it.
USE DATABASE: Selects the database to work with.
CREATE TABLE: Makes sure the necessary tables exist.
INSERT INTO: Now the insert statements will work because you are using the correct database.
